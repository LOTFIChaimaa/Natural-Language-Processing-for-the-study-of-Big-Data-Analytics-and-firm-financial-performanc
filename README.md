# Natural-Language-Processing-for-the-study-of-Big-Data-Analytics-and-firm-financial-performance

Big data analytics gives organizations a way to analyze huge data sets and gather new informa-tion. It helps answer basic questions about business operations and business performance. It alsohelps uncover patterns in the enormous amount of data. In the current data driven world, it is veryessential that big data techniques are applied and analyzed for the growth of organizations. Thereis a lack of investigation on the impact of BDA on firm performance. In this project, we aim tobuild a tool that helps us analyse if a particular company from the list of S&P 500 and TSX60companies has used a particular big data technique from the list of techniques available based onthe information reported in academic literature. The first part of the project deals with buildingthe updated corpus from the academic literature by developing the web scraping tool. Later, withthe help of a text mining tool, we have tried to analyse whether the companies listed have used thetechniques listed.
